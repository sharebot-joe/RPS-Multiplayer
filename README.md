## Rock Paper Scissors!

The classic game is now an online multiplayer game with the help of Firebase's realtime database.

Here are the rules: 

* Two users can play at the same time.
* Both players pick either rock, paper or scissors. After the players make their selection, the game will show whether a tie occurred or if one player defeated the other.
* The game will track each player's wins and losses.
* If you log out and log back in, the game will remember your score.

Have fun and good luck!
